       <li>A part of how I define myself is my extreme interest in Machine learning ,creating programs and algorithms that enable machines<br>
           to take actions without being directed is the thing that fascinates me the most and i wish to use to my knowledge and degree to pursue that</li>
        <li>So for that I keep looking and enrolling for online courses on Coursera, edX, LinkedIn learning etc. in my free time ,at the same time I try to<br>
            participate in social activities which indirectly helps me with my communication skills and also provides professionalism.</li>
            
        <li>Other than my passion for ML, I'm also passionate about athletics and working out, i think it's a major source of relaxation .</li>
        <li>Apart from that I'm a content creator too I make YouTube video and manage it as well, from picking up the camera to rendering the video I do it all<br>
            ,which somehow helps me with my time management</li></ul>
